# HackMTY 2020 project
 This project was created for the 2020 HackMTY Hackathon BlueYonder challenge. It was created by Javier Agostini, Diego Rodriguez, Jessica Trevi√±o, and myself. We created a website that shows the available seats at a particular stadium following proper social distancing protocol as well as the maximum capacity allowed by the government.
